    "- **scikit-learn**: If using scikit-learn, it's inadvisable to explicitly create a new dataset with your one hot or binary-encoded features.  This is because it is better to include them as a section of the larger pipeline which will include the prediction strategy and perhaps modeling.\n",
    "- **h2o**: If using h2o, it is not *strictly* necessary to explicitly define the encodings.  H2o is able to do this [under the hood](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/algo-params/categorical_encoding.html) for most of its algorithms in an optimized way."
