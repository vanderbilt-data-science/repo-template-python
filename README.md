# repo-template-python-exp
This is an alternate template repository for data science projects done in Python where the dataset is small and the processing can be subdivided into shorter, separate notebooks.

### Prerequisites
To most easily run this code out of the box, the following packages must be installed:
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* great expectations
* h2o
* fastai

This is easiest to achieve through first installing an Anaconda distribution, which installs the first 5 packages and all of their dependencies.  The install directions to the other packages may be found on their documentation pages.
